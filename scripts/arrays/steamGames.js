            Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed.

            Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.

            The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.

From a 3rd person perspective, players use a variety of weapons (pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers) and stratagems (turrets, airstrikes, etc.) to shoot and kill the alien threats. Players can also aim down the sights for a more accurate 1st person camera view. Combat is accompanied by frequent sprays of blood and dismemberment as players exterminate the alien forces or players and squad mates are hit by environmental explosions or friendly fire. Enemy encampments and battlefield environments depict bloodstains and dismembered corpses.

            Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.

            You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day.

            If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.

            Imagine a space filled with limitless possibilities.

            Spend your afternoon dogfighting in fighter jets, before winding down in a treehouse that exists floating in a nebula. Make a new best friend while exploring a haunted mansion, right before playing a hand of cards with a robot, alien, and eight-foot tall wolf.

            In VRChat, there are hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of avatars, all created by the users. No matter what you're into, there's a space in VRChat for you. And if there isn't, we'll give you the tools to make your dream a reality.

            While not required to join in on the fun, VRChat was built to take advantage of VR headsets in many unique ways. That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more.

            There's something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find.

            Overwatch is an objective-based game, where two teams of six players compete. Servers are hosted by Blizzard. There are five modes of play: Quick Play, Competitive Play, vs AI, Weekly Brawl, and Custom Games, as well as a Practice Range and Tutorial. There is a leveling system which gives user portraits and loot boxes.

            There are 41 heroes and 51 maps, with more in development. All heroes and maps will be added at no extra cost.[7]

            Cross-play is available between PC and console versions. To play against PC players, console players need to connect to a Battle.net account. Complete cross-platform play is allowed in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom matches, but not Competitive, given the advantages that a mouse/keyboard have over a controller. However, console players can use crossplay for Competitive.

            Set in the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning Left 4 Dead, the #1 co-op game of 2008.
            This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.
            You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.
            You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.
            Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.
